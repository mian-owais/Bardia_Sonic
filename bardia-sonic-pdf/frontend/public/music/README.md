# Audio Files Directory

This directory contains audio files for the Sonic PDF application. 

## Important Notes

1. The files in this directory are just placeholders (1 byte empty files)
2. In a real deployment, you would need to add actual audio files in MP3 format
3. The application will detect missing files and handle them gracefully
4. For a full experience, replace these files with actual MP3 files
